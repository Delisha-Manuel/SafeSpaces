Our solution guards vulnerable people by specifying Safe Spaces where they are expected to be at given times, and raise an alert when there’s any breach so that their guardians or law enforcement can promptly swing into action.
‘SafeSpaces’ is an iOS app coded in the Swift programming language using the XCode development environment. We used Core Location services and MapKit framework for location tracking, AWS Cognito for authentication, AWS SNSNotification Service for remote push notifications, and SwiftUI framework for the user interface
